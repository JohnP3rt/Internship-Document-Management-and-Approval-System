> Streamline internship document submission, tracking, and approval with real-time transparency and efficiency.

## 📄 About

**Internship Document Management and Approval System** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to help **students, coordinators, and directors** efficiently manage the complete internship document lifecycle—from submission to approval.

I built this project to deepen my understanding of:
- **MVC Architecture** and role-based access control
- **RESTful API Design** with complex data relationships
- **Real-time Document Management** systems
- **Multi-user Workflows** and approval pipelines
- **File Upload Handling** and document tracking

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Frontend:** EJS Templates, Bootstrap 5, HTML/CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
* **Authentication:** JWT Tokens, bcryptjs Password Hashing
* **File Storage:** Multer for file uploads
* **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API for Chatbot Assistant
* **Tools:** Git, npm, Postman, VS Code

## ✨ Key Features

* **📤 Multi-Category Document Upload:** Students can upload documents across Pre-Deployment, Legal Forms, and Post-OJT Requirements with real-time progress tracking and status management.

* **👥 Role-Based Access Control:** Three distinct user roles (Student, Coordinator, Director) with tailored dashboards, permissions, and workflows for seamless collaboration.

* **💬 Real-Time Comments & Feedback:** Bidirectional communication system where coordinators can provide feedback on documents and students receive notifications for revisions needed.

* **🤖 AI-Powered Chatbot Assistant:** Integrated Google Gemini API chatbot that answers students' questions about document requirements, upload procedures, and internship processes.

* **🏢 Partnership Application System:** Students can apply for internships at pre-listed partner organizations or add custom companies with location and contact information.

* **📊 Document Status Tracking:** Dynamic status updates (Submitted, Checked, For Revision, Done) with visual progress indicators and coordinator/director review workflows.

* **📢 Announcements & Community Feed:** Coordinators can post announcements with images, and students can comment and engage with updates in real-time.

* **👤 Profile Management:** Complete student profile management with personal information, contact details, course/year tracking, and profile picture uploads.

## 🧠 Technical Decisions & Challenges

### Challenge 1: Complex Document-Comment Relationship
**The Problem:** Documents needed to support multiple comments from different coordinators, but managing nested arrays in MongoDB proved complex when updating specific comments without affecting the entire document array.

**The Solution:** Implemented a hybrid approach using Mongoose subdocuments for comments within documents. Used `markModified()` to ensure MongoDB recognized nested array changes, and created separate routes for adding and deleting comments to handle the complexity cleanly.

```javascript
doc.comments.push(newComment);
profile.markModified('documents');
await profile.save();
```

### Challenge 2: Multi-Role Approval Pipeline
**The Problem:** Different user roles (Student, Coordinator, Director) needed different views and actions on the same documents. The coordinator dashboard initially became cluttered trying to show all students' documents.

**The Solution:** Implemented role-based route guards using middleware and populated only relevant data based on user role. Created separate dashboards for each role and used EJS conditional rendering to show/hide UI elements based on permissions.

```javascript
router.get('/dashboard', auth('coordinator'), async (req, res) => {
  const activeStudents = await User.find({ role: 'student', status: 'active' })
    .populate('studentProfile', 'personalData documents overallStatus partnership');
});
```

### Challenge 3: File Upload Validation & Storage
**The Problem:** Students could upload large files or unsupported formats, consuming server storage and causing validation errors.

**The Solution:** Implemented multi-layer validation:
- **Client-side:** Accept attribute restricts file types
- **Multer config:** File type and size limits (5MB max)
- **Server-side:** Additional MIME type validation before processing

```javascript
const docUpload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    const allowedTypes = ['application/pdf', 'image/jpeg', ...];
    if (allowedTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) cb(null, true);
    else cb(new Error('Invalid file type'));
  },
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 }
});
```

### Challenge 4: Dynamic Partnership Application Data
**The Problem:** The Applications tab needed to group students by selected partnerships, but partnership data was scattered across student profiles without proper indexing.

**The Solution:** Modified the coordinator dashboard query to explicitly select and populate the `partnership` field:

```javascript
const activeStudents = await User.find({ role: 'student', status: 'active' })
  .populate({
    path: 'studentProfile',
    select: 'personalData documents overallStatus partnership'
  });
```

Then implemented client-side grouping to organize students by agency/partnership on the frontend.

### Why This Tech Stack:
- **MongoDB over SQL:** Flexible schema for varying document types and nested comments without migration headaches
- **EJS over React:** Server-side rendering for faster initial load and simpler authentication without token management complexity
- **Express.js:** Lightweight and perfect for this mid-scale application with clear routing and middleware patterns
- **Gemini API:** Free tier supports reasonable chatbot usage for student support without additional infrastructure

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js v18+
* npm or yarn
* MongoDB (local or Atlas connection string)
* Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnP3rt/Internship-Document-Management-and-Approval-System.git
cd Internship-Document-Management-and-Approval-System
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

4. **Initialize the database** (seed director account)
```bash
npm run seed:director
```

5. **Start the server**
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Default Credentials (for testing)
- **Director:** `director@example.com` / `director123`
- **Student & Coordinator:** Create via registration page

## 📋 Usage

### For Students:
1. Register an account and complete your profile
2. Navigate to the **Documents** tab to upload required documents
3. Submit your **Partnership Application** for your chosen internship company
4. Monitor document status and coordinator feedback in real-time
5. Use the **Chatbot** for questions about the process

### For Coordinators:
1. Review pending student accounts in the **Account Requests** tab
2. Check **Review Submissions** to see student document progress
3. Navigate to **Applications** to view partnership applications by company
4. Provide feedback via comments on individual documents
5. Post announcements to keep students informed

### For Directors:
